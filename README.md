# Little Robtics Operating system (LROS) Open beta
LROS is getting ready to start active development powered by the community. The date for open beta release will be early November. 

# Checklist before beta
âœ… Finalize firmware & start program


âœ… Main UI design


âœ… Default Apps


âœ… Truly revolutionize the command line with new features


ðŸŸ¡ Remove unstable and lingering scrapped features from the OS


ðŸŸ¡ Build installer


ðŸŸ¡ Finishing touches of code

Although this list does not look substantial, this code is easily past 1000 lines. Furthermore, a new file structure crafted to be easy to ise has proven to be a large task. As such, two or three weeks is essential to deliver a complete user experience we feel customers will enjoy.
